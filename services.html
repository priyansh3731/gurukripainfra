                <p><span>Search Engine Optimisation (SEO)</span><br>When you use a search engine such as Google or Bing, you type in your query and get a list of results. Often, the page you’re looking for appears in the top few links. But how does the search engine know which results to bring you? Well, it looks at a wide range of features on the website to determine how relevant it is. This includes things like the links to and from other web pages, the content of the page, the keywords and how they’re used, the number of other people who access/share the page, and more.<br>Search Engine Optimisation is the art of understanding how sites like Google index data, and optimising the page and its content to increase quality web traffic (visitors). The goal of SEO is often to make a page or website appear as high as possible in search engine results pages without having to pay for it.</p>

                        While SEO focuses on unpaid methods of boosting visibility in search results, Search Engine Marketing relies on paid options. If you’ve ever Googled something and seen the ‘Ad’ text next to the top results, you’ve seen SEM at work. It’s a practice also sometimes referred to as paid search or PPC (pay-per-click) advertising. Sometimes, people include SEO under the same banner of SEM.<br>With this form of digital marketing, keywords are crucial. These are the popular terms that people search for in relation to a particular product or service. With SEM, you can then bid to have your ad appear in the top results when people search for that term.</p>

                        Any ‘introduction to digital marketing article’ from the last 20 years will show the importance of emails. This emphasis comes as little surprise – data shows that, as of 2018, there were around 111.1 billion consumer emails sent and received each day. Email marketing focuses on driving engagement by sending emails to existing and potential customers.<br>Given that 99% of consumers check their email daily, it’s no surprise that it’s still such a popular way of marketing. Professionals in this area focus on building mailing lists, segmenting customers, targeting and personalising emails, and improving open and click-through rates. When it comes to embracing digital technology for marketing, email remains one of the top skills to know.</p>

                        Online ads and paid media are just about everywhere you look on the internet. As well as the SEM and social media advertising mentioned above, there are also things like banner ads, Google display ads, retargeting ads, and more.<br>As with many of the methods mentioned so far in our introduction to digital marketing, online ads require a considerable amount of insight and planning. Many people use ad blockers to silence adverts on web pages, but networks such as Google Display Network and Facebook’s Audience Network mean ads are once again relevant and less intrusive.

                        Affiliate marketing has become incredibly popular over the last few years. Essentially, this method encourages people to promote other people’s products. When this promotion results in a sale, the affiliate gains a small amount of commission.<br>It’s a technique that benefits everyone involved. For those with a product to sell, you have a network of people promoting it. Those who want to make money without a product, shifting someone else’s can bring a passive income.  There are whole networks of affiliates that businesses can make use of, focusing on a wide variety of niches.

                        Our introduction to digital marketing wouldn’t be complete without mentioning content.

                        An estimated 3.5 billion people around the world have a smartphone. These devices have changed the way we think about marketing, opening up countless opportunities to reach potential customers. Mobile marketing focuses on using a variety of methods to advertise and promote products and services.<br>This type of marketing often makes use of some of the other methods mentioned so far. Along with email, social, and website advertising, there are opportunities such as SMS, MMS, and mobile app marketing.

                        Of all of the methods in our introduction to digital marketing, this is the hardest one to pin down. At its core, viral marketing refers to a type of promotion that relies on the audience to generate buzz. Once a marketing campaign goes beyond its target audience to be widely shared, it’s considered to have ‘gone viral’.<br>These campaigns often tap into the zeitgeist, leveraging things like memes and popular media culture to stand out. However, it’s not usually something that can be forced. Viral marketing relies on the organic spread of content, often on social media channels.
